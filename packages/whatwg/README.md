Fast and highly configurable JSON to CSV converter.
It fully support conversion following the [RFC4180](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc4180) specification as well as other similar text delimited formats as TSV.

`@json2csv/whatwg` exposes two modules to integrate `json2csv` with the WHATWG Stream API for stream processing of JSON data.

This package includes two modules:
  * **[WHATWG Transform Stream](#whatwg-transform-stream):** WHATWG Transform Stream that ingests JSON and outputs csv. Ideal to process streams (http responses, file contents, ...) in WHATWG-compliant systems like the browser, Deno or even Node.js.
  * **[WHATWG Async Parser](#whatwg-async-parser):** Wraps the `Node Transform` to offer a friendly promise-based API.

### Features

- Fast and lightweight
- Support for standard JSON as well as NDJSON
- Scalable to infinitely large datasets (using stream processing)
- Advanced data selection (automatic field discovery, underscore-like selectors, custom data getters, default values for missing fields, ...)
- Support for custom input data transformation
- Support for custom csv cell formatting.
- Highly customizable (supporting custom quotation marks, delimiters, eol values, etc.)
- Automatic escaping (preserving new lines, quotes, etc.)
- Optional headers
- Unicode encoding support
- Pretty printing in table format to stdout

### Other json2csv packages

There are multiple flavours of json2csv:

* **[Plainjs](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@json2csv/plainjs):** Includes the `Parser` API and a new `StreamParser` API which doesn't the conversion in a streaming fashion in pure js.
* **[Node](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@json2csv/node):** Includes the `Node Transform` and `Node Async Parser` APIs for Node users.
* **[WHATWG](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@json2csv/whatwg):** Includes the `WHATWG Transform Stream` and `WHATWG Async Parser` APIs for users of WHATWG streams (browser, Node or Deno).
* **[CLI](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@json2csv/cli):** Includes the `CLI` interface.

And a couple of libraries that enable additional configurations:

* **[Transforms](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@json2csv/transforms):** Includes the built-in `transforms` for json2csv (unwind and flatten) allowing the using to transform data before is parsed.
* **[Formatters](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@json2csv/formatters):** Includes the built-in `formatters` for json2csv (one for each data type, an excel-specific one, etc.). Formatters convert JSON data types into CSV-compatible strings.

## Requirements

- None

## Installation

### **NPM**

You can install json2csv as a dependency using NPM.

```bash
$ npm install --save @json2csv/whatwg
```

### **Yarn**

You can install json2csv as a dependency using Yarn.

```bash
$ yarn add --save @json2csv/whatwg
```

### **CDN**

json2csv WHATWG modules are packaged as ES6 modules.
If your browser supports modules, you can load json2csv WHATWG modules directly on the browser from the CDN.

You can import the latest version:

```html
<script type="module">
  import AsyncParser from 'https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@json2csv/whatwg/src/AsyncParser.js';
  import TransformStream from 'https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@json2csv/whatwg/src/TransformStream.js';
</script>
```

You can also select a specific version:

```html
<script type="module">
  import AsyncParser from 'https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@json2csv/whatwg@6.0.0/src/AsyncParser.js';
  import TransformStream from 'https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@json2csv/whatwg@6.0.0/src/TransformStream.js';
</script>
```

## WHATWG Transform Stream

For browser users, the Streaming API is wrapped in a WHATWG Transform Stream. This approach ensures a consistent memory footprint and avoids blocking JavaScript's event loop.

The async API takes a second options arguments that is directly passed to the underlying streams accepts the same options as the `Stream Parser`. It also support a third and fourth options equivalent to the `writableStrategy` and
`readableStrategy` of a [WHATWG Transform Stream](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/TransformStream/TransformStream) respectively.

This Transform uses the `StreamParser` under the hood and support similar events.

### Usage

```js
import { TransformStream } from '@json2csv/whatwg';

const opts = {};
const asyncOpts = {};
const writableStrategy = {};
const readableStrategy = {};
const parser = new TransformStream(opts, asyncOpts, writableStrategy, readableStrategy);

const response = await fetch('./my-file.json');

await response.body.pipeThrough(parser).pipeTo(writableStream);

// You can also listen for events on the conversion and see how the header or the lines are coming out.
parser
  .addEventListener('header', (header) => console.log(header))
  .addEventListener('line', (line) => console.log(line));
```

#### Parameters

##### Options

## WHATWG Async Parser

To facilitate usage, `WHATWGAsyncParser` wraps `WHATWGTransformStream` exposing a single `parse` method similar to the sync API. This method accepts JSON arrays/objects, TypedArrays, strings and readable streams as input and returns a stream that produces the CSV.

`WHATWGAsyncParser` also exposes a convenience `promise` method which turns the stream into a promise that resolves to the whole CSV.

### Usage

```js
import { TransformStream } from '@json2csv/whatwg';

const opts = {};
const asyncOpts = {};
const writableStrategy = {};
const readableStrategy = {};
const parser = new TransformStream(opts, asyncOpts, writableStrategy, readableStrategy);

const response = await fetch('./my-file.json');

await response.body.pipeThrough(parser).pipeTo(writableStream);

// The parse method return the stream transform readable side.
// So data can be passed to a writable stream (a file, http request, etc.)
parser.parse(data).pipeTo(writableStream);

// You can also listen for events on the conversion and see how the header or the lines are coming out.
parser
  .addEventListener('header', (header) => console.log(header))
  .addEventListener('line', (line) => console.log(line));
```
